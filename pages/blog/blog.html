          Blog #1: How to improve your B2B communication
        </h1>
        <p>
          It is not easy to define B2B communication because it depends on
          specific long-term and shortterm business goals. Every B2B business
          has a different business model and stage of development. It has a
          different structure and organization, goals and priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this text, we will focus on B2B communication with a function to
          build long-term relationships with ideal clients, partners and other
          stakeholders. Usually, we give this function to communication in the
          3rd year of operation. That is when we've partially built the company
          culture, have regular clients, and the first recognition of the young
          brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long-term goal of such communication is to keep the existing
          clients. You want and keep them coming back to you, but also to
          attract new ideal clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          To lay a good foundation, your company should build sound business
          foundations from its start. One of the basic foundations is the
          company culture. Every culture has its values, beliefs, rituals and
          way things work. If you want to communicate effectively with people
          from other cultures and microcultures, you should understand the
          cultural and social context from which you come. Your cultural context
          affects the way you interact with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your business at this stage of development engages a person in
          charge of managing culture and human capital, feel free to include
          them in a communication strategy creation. In my experience, companies
          skimp on culture and human capital management, and that's why they
          usually don't have a person in charge. You should know the culture of
          your own company because we have already said that it is vital for
          creating a communication strategy.
        </p>

        <h4 class="heading--4">
          Here's what you should consider when trying to understand your own
          culture:
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>- What are the values, beliefs and rituals of our culture?</li>
          <li>
            - How do they affect the way you communicate? What do you notice in
            your communication?
          </li>
          <li>
            - What are the non-verbal communication signs that are typical for
            your culture?
          </li>
          <li>- What slang, phrases and idioms do you use in your culture?</li>
          <li>
            - What's your sense of humor? How do you express joy and sadness?
            How do you celebrate success?
          </li>
          <li>
            - Think about your rituals and routines (daily, weekly, seasonal,
            religious, holiday).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="heading--4">
          On the other hand, try to understand the culture and demographics of
          your ideal client because:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            - it will help you understand your target group and who you are when
            you communicate
          </li>
          <li>
            - you will understand their lifestyle, their problems, fears and
            hopes, as well as what makes them happy and what they strive for
            (what they long for)
          </li>
          <li>
            - it allows you to design your communication strategy to build
            long-term and good relationships that appeal to your ideal users
          </li>
          <li>- you can deliver your message to them more effectively</li>
          <li>
            - knowing cultural differences will help you avoid misunderstandings
            and noise in communication
          </li>
          <li>
            - you will know what to expect from them, and you will be able to
            anticipate their reactions and behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="heading--4">
          As you research the culture of your ideal clients, you may find my
          checklist for practising empathy helpful:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. Pay attention to non-verbal communication. Observe body language
            and facial expressions. Try to understand how the person feels. Is
            it scared? Is it worried? Or shy to ask something?
          </li>
          <li>
            2. Listen carefully. Ask clarifying questions. Observe their
            communication style and tone. In your content, repeat what customers
            said about the product, your company, the team, about the people.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Show understanding. Try to put yourself in the customers' shoes.
            Ask questions politely and respectfully. Be sure they won't tell you
            everything they think or everything they want to ask.
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Think about how they might feel along the way. Communication must
            follow their feelings.
          </li>
          <li>
            5. Show that you are genuinely interested in hearing their needs.
            Don't talk about your company's offering, and don't sell. Try to
            understand and try to help.
          </li>
          <li>
            6. Use the language of the customer. Try to avoid jargon, technical
            terms, and professional terms. You will gain trust if you try to
            speak the same language: verbally and non-verbally. In storytelling,
            in visual design, and on the packaging.
          </li>
          <li>7. Offer support and help when you think it's important.</li>
          <li>
            8. After you finish the sale, continue communication. Even if the
            customer does not need support, a nice communication gesture is to
            say thank you and ask if they are satisfied.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="heading--4">
          Why is good communication management necessary?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Many factors influence long-term and good relations between a company
          and its stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>One of them is good communication management.</p>
        <p>
          Don't forget to present your existing customers and their culture
          (jargon, style, habits, aspirations, joys, humor, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          People like to buy from people who are like them. They also like to
          get products and services that people they want to become are already
          using.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good communication management also means you should take care of
          communication directed towards business partners, vendors and
          suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should separately research and create a communication plan for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your company can choose, it is always better to select business
          partners, suppliers and vendors whose culture matches yours because
          your cooperation will be easier and more successful. You will have
          more time to devote to communication aimed at ideal clients.
